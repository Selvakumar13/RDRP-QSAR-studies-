# RDRP-QSAR-studies-: Performed Comparative studies of the different Machine Learning Models used in the implementation of Quantitative
Structureâˆ’Activity Relationship studies for the Identification of RdRp-Targeting Compounds as Potential Therapeutics for COVID-19
and Related Viral Infections. 

The aim was to implement various Machine learning models using python and to narrow down towards the best algorithm which can help
identify and shortlist the compounds showing the best RdRp (i.e RdRp : is a target of interest for curbing Covid-19 activity) inhibition
property with the highest accuracy.
